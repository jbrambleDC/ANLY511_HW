My key takeaways and thoughts after watching Alice Zheng's interview are the following. Machine Learning is essentially, algorithmically exploiting underlying patterns in past data, to predict outcomes for future data with the same featureset. One thing that is interesting, is that companies like Dato are making enterprise solutions that do machine learning. In some ways this poses an existential threat to traditional data scientists, especially given that open source solutions like scikit learn have also taken an API style approach, that effectively empower everyone with some technical knowledge to build predictive applications. Solutions like this, will require hardcore data scientists to build and support them, but will not require hardcore data scientists to implement and use them.

the upside to this, is that the although implementing machine learning algorithms is becoming increasingly automated, feature engineering and feature selection is still something that requires brainpower, and often will require domain specific brainpower. I believe data scientists need to have a breadth of tool based skills but should likely try to build a depth of knowledge pertaining to a mission statement or industry area.
