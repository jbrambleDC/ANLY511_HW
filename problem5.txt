SAS: Companies use SAS mainly because of the support network SAS provides.
SAS as a software package is better suited to less technical users. Many risk
adverse companies avoid switching to R because of learning curve, lack of
support/warranty, distrust of open source, and the fact that R performs in memory
calculations. the downside to SAS is that it is expensive, closed source, and thus
has a small if existant development community.

R: R is open source and has a large and vibrant community that supports and extends
the capability of R. This is also a much cheaper route than using SAS, though
it does not come with the support of SAS.

Python: I would argue that though python does not have quite the same statistical
capabilities as R, it has made significant strides in the realm of visualization,
dataframes, and machine learning. Python is generally faster than R. is also Free
and Open source, and additionally it is much more productionizable than SAS and R
meaning you can easily deploy Python Data Science code within a web app or some
other software package and maintain it with the package management system pip or conda.
