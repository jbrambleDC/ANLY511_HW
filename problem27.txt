 there are 8 even red numbers so the expected value for this is 8/36*$2,
 there are 10 odd red numbers, since there is also a bet on odd the bet here is $2 dollars,
 so we would have 10/36*$4.
 there are 8 odd black numbers so this would yeild 8/36*$2 for expected value
 there are 10 even black numberes, so this yeilds 10/36(-2) for expected value.
 P(W) = P(RE) + P(OR) + P(OB) - P(~R~O) = 18/36 + 8/36 - 10/36. P(W) -> 16/36 or 4/9
 EV -> 8/36(2-2) + 10/36(2) + 8/36(2-2) +10/36(-2) = 0, we are expected to break even
