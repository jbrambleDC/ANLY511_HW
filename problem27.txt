 there are 8 even red numbers so the expected value for this is 8/36*$2,
 there are 10 odd red numbers, since there is also a bet on odd the bet here is $2 dollars,
 so we would have 10/36*$4.
 there are 8 odd black numbers so this would yeild 8/36*$2 for expected value

 so our total EV is 8/36($4) + 10/36($4) = 18/36*$4 = $2 dollars. for any given bet of $2 dollars using this strategy.
 this means we are expected to break even using this strategy.
