a. P(X=x) = P(Y=x|A)
    imagine if we have plotted the pmf p(x), or P(X=x), now imagine if we randomly select a point on the x axis,
    this is uniformly distributed, now imagine that we have generate another value between 0 an 1, if this is less than the graph of the pmf, at that point then we would accept.
    given that this event has been accepted we know it less than the graph at that point, and the probability of that occuring is P(X=x).
    if the point has been accepted we know it is under the graph of the pmf, at the uniformly chosen point Y=x, the probability of this occuring is p(x) or P(X=x).

  prob(A) = l(X)/MN = P(Y=x)*P(U<l(X)/M)
  P(y=x/A) = P(y=x)*P(A/Y=x) = M*P(A/Y=x)/l(x)
  b. l(x)/M
  c. sum(l(x)/M*1/N) = c/NM, summing over all N, will give us c/M!
