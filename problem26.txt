for this case, there are 3 lines, therefore the probability of a win is .33. 
Even though it is not neccesary to triple a bet, 
the most true strategy to the original st. pete system is to triple the bet on each loss and keep the same bet on each win
if a gambler starts with $5:
1. bet $1: lose, now 4$
2. bet $3: lose, now 1$
3. now cannot bet

but with 30$:
1. bet 1$, lose, now 29$
2. bet 3$, lose, now $26
3. bet $9, win, $35

However, bets on losses grow exponentially. if we have $50. the chance of losing 5 straight is .66^5 which is .12% this is not super rare,
in this case we would be betting 3^4 $81 dollars, which is already greater than what we have. This really suggests a Taleb distribution,
given that rare but plausible events can cause catastrophic failure induced by a power law.

lets try it with doubling the bet instead.
in this case we would need 2^4 which is 16$ after the 5th failure. this is still doable for us. however lets see how the performance is:
start with $30:
1. bet 1$ lose, now 29$
2. bet 2$ lose, now 27%
3. bet 4$ win, now 35$ interestingly enough the expected performance is still pretty much the same but we can be bankrupted less quickly.

this implies it is probably better to stick with doubling.
